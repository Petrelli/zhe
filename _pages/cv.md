I received my Ph.D degree from the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University on Sep 19, 2019. Many thanks to my supervisor Chung-Horng Lung, co-supervisor Marc St-Hilaire and Ioannis Lambadaris. Before I joined NJUPT, I was a research engineer at Huawei Ottawa R&D Center, Ottawa, Canada.
