Currently, I am an Assistant Professor with the School of Communications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT), Nangjing, China. Before I joined NJUPT, I was a Research Engineer at Huawei Ottawa R&D Center, Ottawa, Canada. My research interests include multimedia networking, intelligent networks, in-network caching, DCN, and ICN.


What's new
======
Our paper "How to Cache Important Contents for Multi-modal Service in Dynamic Networks: A DRL-based Caching Scheme" has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.

For Prospective Students
======
I am always looking for self-motivated graduate students, if you are interested in what I am doing, please send <a href="mailto:zhezhang@njupt.edu.cn">me</a> your CV. For NJUPT students, I encourage them to do their 4th year project with me.


Advice for prospective students:
* Break out of the undergraduate mentality.
* Own your research.
* Be willing to push back.
* Be active in the social dimension of research.
* Build up your skills, but get out as soon as you can.
* **Most important thing: I believe mentality (initiative, attitude, etc.) is much more important than any technical skills, and the same is true for all fields beyond sciences and engineering. With the right mentality, everything follows.**
