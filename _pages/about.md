Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT), Nangjing, China. Before I joined NJUPT, I was a research engineer at Huawei Ottawa R&D Center, Ottawa, Canada. My research interests include in-network caching, ICN, DCN, multimedia communications, and AI-powered networks.
