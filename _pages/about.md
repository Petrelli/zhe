Currently, I am an Associate Professor with the School of Communications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT), Nangjing, China. Before I joined NJUPT, I was a Research Engineer at Huawei Ottawa R&D Center, Ottawa, Canada. My research interests include multimedia networking, intelligent networks, in-network caching, DCN, and ICN.


What's New
======
Our paper "A Survey on Replica Transfer Optimization Schemes in Geographically Distributed Data Centers" have been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management.


For Prospective Students
======
If you believe life is the sum of experiences, and there's no need to rush into a job just to earn money—allowing time for meaningful pursuits to enrich your life—then we likely share the same philosophy. It is always a pleasure to work with people who share the same philosophy. Additionally, if you are self-motivated and possess strong skills in mathematics, English, or programming (having two skills would be even better), we sincerely welcome you to join our team. Next year, I can accept a maximum of 3-4 master’s students. 

If you are interested in what I am doing, please send <a href="mailto:zhezhang@njupt.edu.cn">me</a> your CV. For NJUPT students, I strongly encourage them to do their 4th year project with me.


Advice for prospective students:
* Break out of the undergraduate mentality.
* Own your research.
* Be willing to push back.
* Be active in the social dimension of research.
* Build up your skills, but get out as soon as you can.
* **Most important thing: I believe mentality (initiative, attitude, etc.) is much more important than any technical skills, and the same is true for all fields beyond sciences and engineering. With the right mentality, everything follows.**
